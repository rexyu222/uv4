<p>Failure is a hard word, and no matter how you
analyze the Vietnam War, that is exactly what it was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The War was a personal failure on a national scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From its covert beginnings, through the
bloodiest, darkest days and finally to the bitter end, this ten-year period of
American history is a national disgrace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some may believe that the only lesson that will ever be learned is a
personal one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you know someone that
died in a muddy jungle there?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did you
have a friend or classmate or a member of your family caught up in this
nightmare?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if you were not
affected on that level, what a waste of time, taxes, resources and the precious
lives of young Americans.</p>

killed, two thousand captured, and three hundred fifty thousand; maimed and
wounded, almost everyone in this country still feels the effects of this
conflict.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Today, the young people of
this country cringe in response to the senselessness and waste of this
struggle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A new generation of college
students, workers and young parents bring a unique perspective to the analysis
of the consequences of this particular war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are the sons and daughters of the men that fought to their death
in the jungles of South East Asia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

deal with some of the more interesting aspects and effects of this war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the Vietnam conflict made absolutely
no sense politically, militarily or economically, the value of analysis must
come on the individual level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
individual soldiers that survived this war are now laced throughout society on
every level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are waiting and have
been patiently biding their time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
waiting to protest or draw attention but waiting for the questions they know
will come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not from a busy country or
politicians or the government but from their own children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They've had nearly 30 years to think about
it and decide what really happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They've also had that time to raise those children, and now we want to
know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

specifically through films.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The third
is a one-on-one interview with a Vietnam veteran.<span style="mso-spacerun:

seven separate topics on which we focus this research, including: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Before the war: </i>1) soldiers reasons for

to the war affected soldiers physically and mentally. 7) Veteran attitudes
toward Americans once home (Government, protestors, family, society).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vietnam War is over and long forgotten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Among those still suffering are several veterans who have felt
forgotten, unappreciated, and even discriminated against.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For some of them ' the trauma of their battle
experiences or their physical disabilities have shattered their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For even more, adjustment to civilian life
has not been easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Imagine if you
had just graduated out of high school and were sent to a guerrilla warfare far
away from your home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the war,
you were exposed to a lot of stress, confusion, anxiety, pain, and hatred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then you were sent back home with no
readjustment to the lifestyle in the states, no deprogramming of what you
learned from the military, and no "welcome home" parades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You are portrayed to the public as a crazed
psychopathic killer with no morals or control over your aggression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You find that there's nobody you can talk to
or who can understand what you've been through, not </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">even your family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As you re-emerge into civilization, you
struggle to establish a personal identity or a place in society because you
lack the proper education and job skills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, there are no supportive groups to help you find your way,
which makes you feel even more isolated, unappreciated, and exploited for
serving your country."<sup>1</sup> This scenario is similar to what many
Vietnam veterans have felt in their transition from battle to home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

profound effect on those who engage in combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Vietnam War, however, was different in many ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First, it was the unpopular war as viewed by
most people today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vietnam veterans
were the first to fight in an American war that could not be recalled with
pride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, it was the first to be
reported in full detail by the media, historians, and scientists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And third, the Vietnam War became a metaphor
for American society that connoted distrust in the government, and the
sacrifice of American lives for poorly understood and deeply divided values and
principles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the veterans' return
to the states, many exhibited significant psychiatric symptoms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These ranged from difficulty sleeping to
vivid flashbacks, and are now recognized as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>

characteristic symptoms following a psychologically distressing event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"It begins with an event in which the
individual is threatened with his or her own death or the destruction of a body
part, to such humiliation that their personal identity may be lost."<sup>2</sup>
Vietnam veterans who experience PTSD have a feeling of helplessness,
worthlessness, dejection, anger, depression, insomnia, and a tendency to react
to tense situations by using survival tactics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Combat experience remains the variable most often linked to PTSD among
Vietnam veterans. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The frequency of PTSD
was a lot higher among those with high levels of exposure to combat compared to
the noncombatants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>PTSD was not taken
seriously until the 1980's when many Vietnam veterans were complaining of
similar symptoms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These symptoms had been
noticed after previous wars but there were only a couple of cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In some cases, veterans did not experience
their symptoms until a year after they returned.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was very easy for the government to ignore the effects
of PTSD because it had such a delayed reaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

factor that affected the adjustments made by American soldiers and their
attitudes was the DEROS system (date of expected return from overseas).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every individual serving in Vietnam knew
before leaving the U.S. when he was scheduled to return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An individual's rotation lasted twelve to
thirteen months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for the
individual American soldier, the main attribute affecting combat motivation in
the war was the operation of the rotation system.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The soldier's primary concern was focused on reaching his
personal DEROS instead of preparing and fighting in battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival to his unit and the first weeks
thereafter, the soldier was excited to be in the war zone and may even have
looked forward to engaging with the enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"However, after the first serious encounter, he lost his enthusiasm
for combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As he began to approach the
end of his tour, the soldier noticeably began to give up; he became reluctant
to engage in offensive combat operations."<sup>3</sup> Thus, as soldiers
came closer to their expected departure, they either withdrew themselves from
battle or just became more careful in order to survive and return home safely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

conducted on Vietnam veterans, the overall consensus is that American soldiers
despised as well as feared the Vietnamese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Race was a critical factor affecting both the military and social
experiences of American troops in Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Psychologists believe that there were two types of war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first was considered the "good"
war which took place from 1964-1968.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The second was the "bad" war which occurred from
1968-1972.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The earlier war was very
conventional and traditional in that it involved the usual confrontation
between opposing armies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"From the
American G.l.'s point of view, the enemy was the North Vietnamese army whose
members could be easily recognized and thus killed legally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The G.l.'s could relate easily to Vietnamese
villagers, talk to them, and eat with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The later war involved the confrontation between American troops and
Vietnamese guerrillas as well as civilians who sometimes shielded the
troops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The guerrilla warfare had booby
traps and mines planted by an invisible enemy, or it seemed like to the
Americans."4 These traps caused a lot of casualties among the American
troops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At this stage of the war,
Americans began to view all Vietnamese soldiers and civilians as the enemy and
as racially inferior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the initial
contact in Vietnam occurred in customary warfare activity, American's race
awareness was hidden, practically dormant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, when the enemy went into civilian villages and countryside to
fight a guerrilla war, consisting of ambushes, mines, and booby traps, this
resulted in closer contact with the Vietnamese people blurring the distinction
between soldier and civilian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With the

marijuana because it sped up the perception of time, whereas marijuana slowed
it down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because marijuana, heroin, and

the stress and sometimes to forget what they saw on the battlefield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As they returned to the states, drugs were
not as easy to obtain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the

men were refused employment because they had served in Vietnam and employers
considered this evidence of drug addiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

drink alcohol and do drugs not only to forget what they saw in Vietnam but to
cope with the frustration and anguish of not being accepted into society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

formed, directed, and censored for military and political reasons, which were designed
to build up morale at home or show that there was progression and production of
the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the soldier returned

actually experienced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Psychologists
found that it was important not only to prepare the veteran for the necessary
process of adjustment, but it was also important to prepare the people at

though the federal government wanted to place veterans at a disadvantage to

rotated home on a specific date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
absence of a warm welcome home parade can be attributed to this rotational
system because it returned veterans from the war in an individual and isolated

individualized event for each man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
war began the day he arrived and ended the day he left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of this individualism, unit
integration suffered because complete strangers were sometimes transferred into

movies actually had film crews on the battlefields taking pictures and rolling
live footage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><u>In Good Morning</u> <u>Vietnam</u>,
the main character is a popular Vietnam radio disc jockey with thousands of
soldiers as everyday listeners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><u>In

media is as a tool to shape how the War was portrayed for both the soldiers and
civilians back in the U.S. These portrayals of the War could either be in favor
of the War and American involvement, or against our soldiers and the War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, a film crew in Full Metal
Jacket interviews the soldiers for a program to show to the public back in the
States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They ask the soldiers,
"Does America belong in Vietnam?" A soldier responds, "I don't
know." By showing this type of answer to society back at home, people
would feel that even the soldiers are uncertain as to why they are at war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would promote people to be against
American involvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The newspaper
editor in Full Metal Jacket acknowledged how the War was being portrayed back
at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"This is not a popular
war." He then explained to his journalists that their job was to try and
portray the War as positive as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said, "We run only two kinds of stories here: Stories which win
the hearts and minds of society, and combat action that results in a
kill-winning the war." Good Morning Vietnam also portrayed this concept of
the media selectively picking and choosing which news it wants to report.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before the disc jockey is permitted to read
the news over the air and inform the soldiers in Vietnam of the latest
developments, he had to first give it to radio officials who checked its
content.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The officials would censor
negative events out of the report, thus shaping the truth about what was really
happening in the War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reasons for going Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both the
psychological study and the one-on-one interview found that the majority of
people that went to Vietnam were drafted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Interestingly, the majority of the films portrayed the main character as
volunteering for their duty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">We feel </i>this difference occurs because
films want to simply make a good story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When someone volunteers with patriotic and noble aspirations to serve
their great country it is easier to show more of a change in their own beliefs

interesting scenario that a simple draftee that was forced to go against his will.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

like they had to in order to survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the psychological study section found that as soldiers were
nearing their departure date from Vietnam, they became more reluctant to put
their lives on the line, whereas the other two sections portrayed the soldiers
as becoming less emotional killing machines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

section which was soldiers' feeling about the Vietnamese people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The overall portrayal was one of distaste
for the Vietnamese, "bordering on venomous" as the Vietnam veteran
proclaimed in the personal one-on-one interview.<span style="mso-spacerun:

and fear of the Vietnamese people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

mindless killing machines, but rather that some did have sympathy for the
Vietnamese people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

the fact that not all of the soldiers in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

the psychological study, the information concentrated solely on these types of
soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We believe there is a
correlation between those who were psychologically effected and those who
feared and distrusted the Vietnamese the most--i.e. those who had the least
amount of sympathy for the Vietnamese.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

escape the hell in which the soldiers were living on a day to day basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">We
feel </i>that alcohol was discussed in every section based on the simple fact

War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the media
intentionally put emphasis on either the positive or negative aspects of the
War (depending on its particular stance -for or against the War) in order to
shape how people accepted and understood what was going one in Vietnam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This agenda-setting effected how both the

thoroughly shows some angles of the psychological effects of the Vietnam
War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overall, throughout the three
sections, the majority of topics were similar in their depiction of the effects
of war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, differences did
exist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To a great degree, these
differences can be accounted for due to the biases that exist within each
separate source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The psychological
study obviously sought out information pertaining solely to accounts of
soldiers who had been psychologically (negatively) affected by the War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Media is also biased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The films obviously portrayed characters and
events that would develop into the most interesting story line (attracting
larger audiences and thus greater profits).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also realize that the films will be biased by the film maker's own
personal point of view or agenda on how to portray the Vietnam War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, even though the personal account is
I 00% accurate, it is only I 00% accurate to that person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With each of these biases, gathering
information from just one of these sources would be less thorough and valid
than what our combined research adds up to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Despite these biases, we feel the similar findings among all three
sources of information are accurate and strong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
